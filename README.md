# Diploma-CI-CD-Demo

This is a repository used to demonstrate GitHub's CI/CD functionalities using GitHub Actions for my diploma. The repository contains a simple JavaScript app with Vector and Matrix themed classes and functions, and a simple HTML UI. It started as a homework project and it was given a graphical upgrade and tests for all the functions.
